# Loan Default Prediction – ML Project

This project focuses on building a classification model to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default. It addresses a real-world use case relevant to the finance and lending industry.

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. Various models are implemented and compared, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are used to assess model performance. The project is designed to demonstrate end-to-end implementation of a supervised machine learning pipeline in Python.

This project was developed as part of my Post Graduate Program (PGP) in AI/ML and represents a key milestone in applying data science to real-world business problems.



This machine learning project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default. The model helps financial institutions in assessing loan risk.
