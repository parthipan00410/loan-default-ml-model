# loan-default-ml-model
This project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default using machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree), and performance evaluation. Built as part of my PGP in AI/ML program to simulate real-world financial risk assessment.
